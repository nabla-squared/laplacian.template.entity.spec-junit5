# laplacian:template:entity.spec-junit5

A laplacian template that generates Junit5 test cases
which assert that the entity classes generated by the `laplacian:entity:kotlin` template
are behave as the description written in the `examples` property in the model.



## Getting started

Firstly, you need to add the following entry to your `laplacian-module.yml` :

```yaml
project:
  group: ${your.project.group}
  name: ${your.project.name}
  type: project
  version: "1.0.0"
  templates:
  ## ↓↓ ADD ↓↓ ##
  - group: laplacian
    name: entity
    subname: spec-junit5
    version: "1.0.0"
  ## ↑↑ ADD ↑↑ ##
```

To reflect the change, you need to type the following command in your console :
```bash
./gradlew lM
```

Then put some model files under the *./model* directory and type the following command to generate files:
```bash
./gradlew lG
```
